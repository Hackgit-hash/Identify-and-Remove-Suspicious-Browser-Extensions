**Task-7-Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions**

**Objective**

The objective of this task was to identify and remove any suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions that could affect security, privacy, or performance.

**Tools Used**

Google Chrome (or any modern web browser such as Firefox)


**Steps I Followed**

1)I opened my browser’s extension manager using the URL chrome://extensions/ in Chrome.

2)I carefully reviewed all installed extensions and checked their names, sources, and permissions.

3)For each extension, I clicked on Details to see what permissions it required and whether it came from a trusted developer.

4)I searched the extension names online and read reviews to confirm their legitimacy.

5)I identified any extensions that were unfamiliar, unused, or had excessive permissions.

6)I removed the suspicious extensions by clicking the Remove button.

7)After that, I restarted my browser to apply the changes and checked for improved performance.

**Observations**

1)Suspicious extensions often requested unnecessary permissions like reading and modifying data on all websites.

2)Removing them helped improve browser performance and eliminated random pop-up ads.

3)Trusted extensions from known developers were safe to keep.

4)Regularly reviewing and cleaning browser extensions is an important part of maintaining browser security.


**How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users**

##Malicious extensions can track browsing activities without consent.

##They can inject ads or redirect users to phishing or scam websites.

##Some may steal sensitive information like login credentials or browsing history.

##Such extensions can also slow down the system or cause browser crashes.


**Conclusion**

From this activity, I learned how to identify legitimate and suspicious browser extensions.

Regularly reviewing and removing unused or unknown extensions helps maintain both security and browser performance.

Permissions and reviews are strong indicators of an extension’s trustworthiness.

A clean browser environment ensures safer browsing and protects personal data from malicious add-ons.
